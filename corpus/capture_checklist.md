# On-Set VFX Data Capture Checklist

Reference checklist for VFX data acquisition during principal photography. Missing on-set capture is the single most common cause of post-production cost overruns.

## Per-Setup Captures (Every VFX Setup)

### Lighting Reference
- [ ] **Chrome ball**: 2+ exposures (normal + 2-stops over), matching hero camera position
- [ ] **Grey ball**: Same position as chrome ball, helps calibrate diffuse lighting
- [ ] **Color chart**: X-Rite ColorChecker or equivalent, in-frame or reference photo
- [ ] **HDRI panorama**: 360-degree bracketed exposure panorama from subject position (if possible, use a dedicated HDRI camera rig)

### Camera Data
- [ ] **Lens**: Focal length, T-stop, focus distance
- [ ] **Camera height**: Measured from ground to lens center
- [ ] **Camera tilt/pan**: Measured or estimated
- [ ] **Sensor/film back size**: Noted per camera body
- [ ] **Frame rate**: Especially if non-standard (overcrank/undercrank)
- [ ] **Lens distortion grid**: Shot once per lens (checkerboard pattern)

### Set Reference
- [ ] **Clean plate**: Empty set, same camera, same lighting, same lens, 5-10 seconds minimum
- [ ] **Tracking markers**: Documented positions (photo + measurements from fixed references)
- [ ] **Scale reference**: Measured object in frame (tape measure, known-height stand-in)
- [ ] **Reference photos**: Wide angles of full set from multiple positions

## Green / Blue Screen Setups

- [ ] **Even lighting**: Measured with spot meter, variation < 0.5 stop across screen
- [ ] **Spill control**: Negative fill or spill suppression flags positioned
- [ ] **Screen condition**: No wrinkles, tears, or visible seams in camera frame
- [ ] **Edge treatment**: Sufficient screen beyond actor's range of motion (minimum 2 feet)
- [ ] **Floor screen**: If full-body shots, green/blue floor extending beyond footprint area
- [ ] **Interactive lighting**: On-set lighting matching intended background environment
- [ ] **Hair/costume check**: Fine hair, translucent fabrics, and reflective materials flagged to VFX supervisor

---

## Stunt / Wire Work

- [ ] **Wire diagram**: Photo/sketch of wire attachment points
- [ ] **Wire color**: Matched to background where possible (green for green screen, etc.)
- [ ] **Clean pass**: Camera running same move without performer (for background reconstruction)
- [ ] **Witness cameras**: Additional angles capturing stunt for reference
- [ ] **Safety equipment documentation**: What needs removal in post (pads, mats, safety lines)

---

## CG Character / Creature Shots

- [ ] **Eyeline reference**: Physical stand-in or tennis ball at correct height/position
- [ ] **Lighting reference at creature position**: Chrome/grey ball at creature's location
- [ ] **Scale reference**: Creature height/size marker for actor interaction
- [ ] **Contact point reference**: Where creature touches ground/objects
- [ ] **Performance reference**: If available, puppeteer or actor in motion capture suit for animation reference

---

## Vehicle Shots

- [ ] **Vehicle reference photos**: All angles, detail shots of paint, damage, identifying features
- [ ] **Motion reference**: Practical vehicle pass for speed, suspension behavior, tire interaction
- [ ] **Road/terrain surface**: Texture reference photos for tire interaction and dust/debris
- [ ] **Lighting on vehicle position**: Chrome ball at vehicle trajectory height

---

## Environment / Set Extension

- [ ] **LiDAR scan**: Full set scan including ceiling, floor, and any visible exterior
- [ ] **Photogrammetry**: Dense photo coverage of set surfaces for texture reference
- [ ] **Set plans**: Architectural drawings or measurements
- [ ] **Sight lines**: Photos from hero camera positions showing where extensions begin
- [ ] **Ceiling height**: Measured, especially for interior set extensions
- [ ] **Window views**: Reference photos of intended exterior view (or brief description)

---

## Destruction / Pyro

- [ ] **Pre-destruction reference**: Complete documentation of pristine state
- [ ] **Practical element timing**: Frame-accurate timing notes for practical effects
- [ ] **Safety perimeter**: Documented for CG augmentation of danger zones
- [ ] **Dust/debris settle time**: How long practical dust takes to clear (for CG matching)
- [ ] **Multiple takes**: If practical effect is single-use, multiple cameras required

---

## Screen / Monitor Inserts

- [ ] **Screen dimensions**: Measured physical screen size
- [ ] **Screen position/angle**: Relative to camera
- [ ] **Tracking markers on screen**: Small markers at corners or edges
- [ ] **Screen brightness**: Matched to scene lighting (for reflection interaction)
- [ ] **Content specification**: What should appear on screen (provided to editorial/VFX)

---

## Post-Shoot Deliverables

- [ ] **Camera reports**: All takes, circled takes, notes
- [ ] **VFX line-up sheets**: Per VFX shot, reference photos, notes from VFX supervisor
- [ ] **HDRI files**: Processed and labeled per setup
- [ ] **LiDAR data**: Processed point clouds, labeled per set
- [ ] **Witness camera footage**: Synced and labeled
- [ ] **Lens grids**: Processed distortion data per lens

## Common Oversights

1. **Forgetting clean plates** when set is redressed between setups
2. **Missing HDRI** for night exteriors (yes, you still need it)
3. **No scale reference** in green screen shots (CG elements will be wrong size)
4. **Tracking markers too small** for the camera distance (VFX can't see them)
5. **Tracking markers too few** (minimum 8-12 visible markers per shot)
6. **Not shooting lens grids** for anamorphic lenses (distortion is extreme)
7. **Missing witness cameras** for one-take stunts and pyro
8. **No reference for interactive lighting** changes (lightning flashes, explosions, fire glow)
