Powersuits are likely hero CG characters appearing throughout the film - development costs here support other sequences.

The 'plasma cutters' suggest energy FX requiring specialized FX artist work. Coordinate destruction continuity across scenes 80, 82, 84, 86 - this is the final state. Previs strongly recommended for this sequence to establish shot design, camera moves, and destruction choreography before expensive production.

The 'diving from above' action requires full 3D creature animation with complex flight dynamics and interaction. Recommend extensive previs (2-3 months) to lock shot design before production.
